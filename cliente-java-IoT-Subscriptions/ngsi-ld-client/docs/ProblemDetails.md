# ProblemDetails

The definition of the general \"ProblemDetails\" data structure from IETF RFC 7807 is reproduced inthis structure. Compared to the general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807, the \"status\" and \"detail\" attributes are mandated to be included by the present document, to ensure that the response contains additional textual information about an error. IETF RFC 7807 foresees extensibility of the \"ProblemDetails\" type. It is possible that particular APIs in the present document, or particular implementations, define extensions to define additional attributes that provide more information about the error. The description column only provides some explanation of the meaning to Facilitate understanding of the design. For a full description, see IETF RFC 7807. 

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**type** | **URI** | A URI reference according to IETF RFC 3986 that identifies the problem type. It is encouraged that the URI provides human-readable documentation for the problem (e.g. using HTML) when dereferenced. When this member is not present, its value is assumed to be \&quot;about:blank\&quot;.  |  [optional] |
|**title** | **String** | A short, human-readable summary of the problem type. It should not change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of localization. If type is given and other than \&quot;about:blank\&quot;, this attribute shall also be provided. A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.  It SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of localization (e.g., using proactive content negotiation; see [RFC7231], Section 3.4).  |  [optional] |
|**status** | **Integer** | The HTTP status code for this occurrence of the problem. The HTTP status code ([RFC7231], Section 6) generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.  |  |
|**detail** | **String** | A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.  *InvalidRequest: The request associated to the operation is  syntactically invalid or includes wrong content. If an HTTP request  for an operation contains parameters that are incompatible with the  operation, or it contains values of the \&quot;options\&quot; parameter that are  not supported by the operation, an HTTP error response of type  InvalidRequest should be returned.    |  |
|**instance** | **URI** | A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem. It may yield further information if dereferenced.  |  [optional] |
